# The Pine Forest

Final Project for Udacity VRND

## Capstone Planning Document

# Description
For my Capstone Project, I will be building an interactive tour experience for the Google Cardboard. The subject is the Pine Forest of the city of Guardamar, in the south east coast of Spain, which is a great example of reforestation and ecological sustainability in the  relation between a city and the nature around.
Besides the explanations and pictures of the reforestation process, the main idea is to build 2 scenes in Unity, to describe the state of the city before and after the operation. Using a navigation system, users will be able to walk around in both situations, experiencing the differences and hopefully developing an awareness for a more armonic relation between humans and nature.
# Structure
The experience will start with a welcome panel. It will have welcome text describing the experience, and some navigation buttons to start/restart the tour. At least, user can choose to visit the landscape before the reforestation, and in present state. Maybe, if possible include a third scene ‘during the works’. Inside each scene, user can move freely/waypoints to visit some interesting places: in the first scene the sand on the beach, the semiburied village. In the second scene, the works, the small plants, wood fence, trees nurseries, wells, mules and workers and in the third the actual forest, and the modern city. In these points, panels or narration (audio sources) can describe moments of the process.
